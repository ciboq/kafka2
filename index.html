        <p>Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm 
            that keeps changing directions. 
            You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. 
            You turn again, but the storm adjusts. 
            Over and over you play this out, 
            like some ominous dance with death
            just before dawn. 
            Why? 
            Because this storm 
            isn't something that blew in from far away, 
            something that has nothing to do with you.</p>
